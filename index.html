<h2> Early Childhood</h2>

<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"><p>
This picture, I believe is a perfect representation of how I was as a kid, you can see the mischief in my eyes and smile, which is
 propably why I was always getting pulled back by My Mom, I would always wander off into places, but not without making sure that My Mom 
was behind me. I don't know why, but as a kid, I always had this irrational feeling that I would get lost or kidnapped, which is why you 
would often see me dragging My Mom away to explore something. Despite of this mischief, I believe that these little adventures I dragged my Mom to played a really big part in
my personality growth. I was able to grow confidently, and was given the opportunity to make my own decisions, no matter the size. These experiences allowed the older me to 
be a person who is confident in their decisions and believe that their opinion does matter, as growing up I was always given the chance to voice my concerns. I am very much 
grateful to My Mom for allowing me to make these decisions, because by doing this I was given the mentality that my words matter, which gave me the confidence which I still carry up to this day.

<h2> Tween years </h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"> <p>
This picture shows me as a tween, I went through that awkward phase where I didn't know how to smile, and I'm glad I got over it. During this time I spent most of my days tailing 
My Mom, going to the events she was invited to, and learning about the different cultures which were found in Pampanga. This is the time where I really enjoyed travelling, going from 
one place to another, in just a matter of a few minutes. I truly believe that these experiences helped me in becoming the independent woman I am today, because as I see my Mom interact 
with all these different people, I see Her attitude towards different situations, and how She handles them, so once I encounter difficult times, I always remember My Mom, and how much of a 
strong person She is. These experiences helped me become a person who is aware of all the different cultures going on around me, it has also allowed me to become an indpendent person who is 
not afraid of new ventures, but rather looks forward to them. Because I truly believe that to grow as a person, you must face challenges, trials and errors, because without these obstacles,
a person can only grow as much as their safety blanket allows them to, which in most cases is quite restricted. I would like to thank my Mom for taking me on these adventures, because in doing these,
I realized that feeling scared and nervous is never something to be afraid of or be treated as a weakness, but rather should be considered as a chance for you to grow and explore new wonders.

<h2> Life as an Adoloscent</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"><p>
Now that I am all grown up, I can confidently say that I have experienced as much as I can, I have traveled and explored different aspects of my life. But now, in this stage of life, I plan to explore a 
deeper side within me, the one which cannot be seen but deeply affects a person. As a kid being emotional was not really something I focused on. 
But, as I grew older I started to wonder, Why do I feel like this? What's this emotion? And I plan on finding the answers to these questions. As a kid I explored different places, as a tween
 I explored different cultures, but now, as a teenager, I plan to explore myself. I plan on finding out the 
different things about myself, the things which make me who I am, My interests, My strengths, and most especially My weaknesses.
I do not plan on destroying these weaknesses, instead I would like to use these and turn them into things which make me the person that I am.
Instead of healing my outside self, and indulging in toxic habits, I will choose to heal My inner-self, the one which does not show physically, 
but shows drastic effects in my everyday life. I plan on living my teenage years as those that are filled with laughter, joy, and all kinds of 
experiences. I plan on living life as the type of person who know what She likes, and knows what her worth is. Becuase I strongly believe that to love others, one must love one's self.

<h3>Life is like an adventure, you will face mountains of problems, rivers of tears, and jungles of opportunity
, but always remeber to look toward the horizon, the better things and see these as an inspiration for you
to keep going on.</h3>
